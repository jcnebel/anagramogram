# anagramogram
Simple Angular 1.8.3 app which tells you if two words are anagrams of each other.

I made this in 2015 about 2 hours after a job interview, to show the prospective employer that I could learn Angular and do the job. I got the job. :)
I recently made the minor change of updating the font that was included due to some ambiguity regarding the licensing - better safe than sorry.
