# anagramogram
Simple Angular 1.8.3 app which tells you if two words are anagrams of each other.

I made this in 2015 about 2 hours after a job interview, to show the prospective employer that I could learn Angular and do the job. 

I got the job. :)

It's really simple, it basically rearranges the letters of each word alphabetically, and then starts comparing letters by index.  If we have have a mismatch, then we don't have an anagram!
